# tidehack-plus-leaked
winner of the "world's saddest meteor skid" award for two years running. does this even count as a leak? it's literally just a meteor rename.

dumbass faggot bitch fucking begged me to make his shitty skid of yoink rat actually compile so he could tokenlog people he knew irl "for revenge". if this isn't the biggest case of coping and seething in the history of the internet i don't know what is.

~~webhook is apparently still up, but most of the actual rat doesnt work to my knowledge.~~ thanks to berii most of the rat is non-functional. i say "most" since the chromegrabber is an external file which uses its own webhook i think? if you run chrome 80 or lower dont run

i'll put more shit here later cuz i'm tired right now lulz

@TldeHack-Dev hello
