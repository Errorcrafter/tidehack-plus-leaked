# TideHack+ "Leaked"
winner of the "world's saddest meteor skid" award for two years running. does this even count as a leak? it's literally just a meteor rename.

dumbass faggot bitch fucking paid me to make his shitty skid of yoink rat actually compile so he could tokenlog people he knew irl "for revenge". if this isn't the biggest case of coping and seething in the history of the internet i don't know what is. the best part is that he chose me becuase he saw me comment on a bloody r/minecraftclients post about meteor client addons.

there is absolutely no HWID locking or auth or anything. its just a straight paste of a very old meteor dev build with random features removed. retard didn't even skid from rejects or any addon leaks to make it look at least somewhat credible, like other skids like mathax do.

for anyone dumb/brave/bored enough to try to dig through some 12 year-old's java """""code""""", the """""rat""""" is in [`utils/grabber`](https://github.com/Errorcrafter/tidehack-plus-leaked/tree/main/src/main/java/risingtide/tidehack/utils/grabber). the excessive use of quotes is due to the fact that it is, once again, practically identical to yoink rat, except he had to remove a lot of its features since fabric doesn't allow you to do things like take screenshots and some other stuff. since he invited me to the server he was sending the rat info to i managed to actually get his fucking token because he used the sAME FUCKING WEBHOOK TO TEST THE RAT BEFORE HE GOT ME TO DEV FOR HIM HOW ARE PEOPLE THIS FUCKING STUPID

fortunately, the people he was trying to rat were absolutely retarded and didnt even have the correct version of java installed and got jvm errors before they could actually run the client

thanks to acaiberii the webhooks are now dead, so you're mostly safe. i say "mostly" since the chromegrabber is an external file which uses its own webhook i think(?) so if you use chrome 80 or lower dont run this.

## Screenshots I thought were funny
(they are a bit big idk how to resize them :skull:)
